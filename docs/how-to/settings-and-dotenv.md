# Settings & dotenv

> How to configure a Runefile and feed values to task bodies. Part of the [guides](README.md);
> full syntax in the [language guide](../runefile.md#variables-and-settings).

## Concept

**Variables** (`name := value`) are reusable values resolved statically and interpolated with
`{{ }}`. **Settings** (`set ...`) configure the whole file. A project **`.env`** file is
loaded into task environments, so configuration and secrets come from the environment — never
hard-coded.

## Syntax

```rune
out := "dist"
# `/` joins paths (forward slash on every OS).
bin := out / "app"

# Export Runefile variables into task environments.
set export
# Override the shell for (sh) bodies (rarely needed).
set shell := ["bash", "-cu"]

build:
    @echo "building {{bin}}"
```

A `.env` beside the Runefile is loaded automatically:

```text
GREETING=hello
```

## Runnable example

See **[examples/settings-dotenv](../examples/settings-dotenv/README.md)** — `set export` plus a
`.env` value reaching the body.

## Pitfalls

- **Secrets live in the environment, not the Runefile.** Put them in `.env` (kept out of
  version control) or the real environment. They never belong in a committed Runefile, and are
  never exposed to agents (see [AI agents](../mcp.md)).
- **`set export` is opt-in.** Without it, Runefile variables interpolate into commands but
  aren't necessarily present as environment variables for sub-processes.
- **Paths use `/`.** The path-join operator emits forward slashes on every OS for portability.

## Next steps

- [Parameters](parameters.md) — per-invocation inputs (vs. file-level settings).
- [Executors](executors.md) — how the environment reaches each body.
